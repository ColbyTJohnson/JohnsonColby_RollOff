## About the Game

### Why Roll Off?
Roll Off is the result of a one-month game jam as part of my undergraduate degree in Game Design at Full Sail. I was working on a  dual-stick platforming mobile game at the time which laid the groundwork for Roll Off. Other pieces of the month-long project included weekly testing and user surveys to iterate on the core experience throughout the month.

### How to Play
There are two game modes, local multiplayer and single player. In multiplayer, the players must try to knock each other off of the screen in any direction. Once a play begins moving, they cannot stop. So they must be quick to decide which direction to move next. There are also powerups that occasionally drop and provide advantages to players. In single player, the user must reach the end flag without falling off of the screen.
